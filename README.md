## What is Octopy Framework?

Octopy is a lightweight PHP web framework inspired by [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework and its use is almost like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). For people who build web
sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly
needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. Octopy lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code
needed for a given task.

In addition to the features above this framework is very lightweight, only measuring less than 1 megabytes because there is no dependency on other packages, but you are free to use
packages from outside using composer.

Octopy is right for you if:

* You are not interested in large framework like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).
* You eschew complexity, favoring simple solutions.
* You want a framework with a small footprint.
* You want a framework with zero dependencies.
* You want to make things that are often made quickly.

Do not use this if:

* You need a full production-ready solution.
* You prefer not to work with potential breaking changes and/or features not yet working properly as we improve it during alpha period.
